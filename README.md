**SwapLogs**

This project is to create full-world full-stack application and we have decided to create a Password Sharing for online streaming service. The idea is to enable people to swap streaming services when they are not in use or to explore new content on another streaming service.

Project Requirements
-
- Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

- Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.

- Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

- Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

- Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.

- Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

- Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

- Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

- Have a polished UI.

- Be responsive.

- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

- Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

- Have a professional README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
